Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
</Text>

I'm Lara, a under construction developer, currently living in Berlin.

I used the [Minimal Blog Gatsby Theme](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog) to play around with shadowing concept.

It was a 2 day experiment, full of ups and downs, but I learned a lot about the theme file structure, where to look for correct files to shadow and how to modify them.

Please check out the official Gatsby documentation if you want to learn more about the [shadowing concept](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/).

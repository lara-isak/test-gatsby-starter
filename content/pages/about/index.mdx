Hi!

My name is Lara and I'm an under construction full-stack developer.
I come from beautiful, sunny Split, Croatia, but currently living in Berlin. I've been working as a IT Support Engineer / Project Manager for the past 10ish years and decided it was the right time to change my career path and embark on the web dev journey. 👩‍💻

I started following The Odin Project Foundations path and after that path is finished I'll continue with the TOP JavaScript path and Full Stack Open path.
